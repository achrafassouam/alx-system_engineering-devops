Server Infrastructure Breakdown:
--------------------------------

-   **Server:** A powerful computer or software program that provides resources and services to other devices (clients) over a network. These services can include storing data, running applications, or delivering web pages.

-   **Domain Name:** A human-readable address that translates to a server's IP address (a numerical address). Users can easily remember "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]" instead of a complex string of numbers.

-   **DNS Record (www):** In "www.foobar.com [invalid URL removed]", the "www" is a specific DNS record type. It points web browsers to the server hosting the website's content.

-   **Web Server:** Software on a server that delivers web content (like HTML files, images) to a user's web browser when requested. Think of it as the middleman between your request and the website's files.

-   **Application Server:** Software that handles the dynamic aspects of a website, like processing user logins, generating customized content, or interacting with a database. Web server delivers static content, while application server handles interactivity.

-   **Database:** A structured storage system that holds website data like user information, product details, or blog posts. The application server retrieves and manipulates this data as needed.

-   **Communication Protocol:** Servers use protocols like HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with user devices. HTTP defines how information is formatted and transmitted between the server and the user's web browser.

Potential Issues:
-----------------

-   **Single Point of Failure (SPOF):** If a critical component (like the web server) fails, the entire website goes down. This is a SPOF.

-   **Downtime during Maintenance:** Deploying new code or performing server maintenance often requires restarting the server, causing temporary downtime for users.

-   **Scalability Limitations:** A single server may struggle to handle a surge in website traffic. This can lead to slow loading times or crashes.
